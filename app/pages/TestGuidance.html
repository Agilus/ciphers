    <h2 class="ol" id="Timed"><span class="quser">All Events</span>Timed question</h2>
    <p>This should be an Aristocrat with a hint (see <a href="#Aristocrat">Aristocrats/Patristocrats</a>).</p>
    <h2 class="ol" id="Atbash"><span class="quser">All Events</span>Atbash Cipher {3.e.i.}</h2>
    <p>The Atbash is one of the easiest Ciphers for students to encode or decode because the alphabet
        is fixed. The letter <b>v</b> will always stand for the letter
        <b>e</b> and vice-versa. There should only be one
        Atbash Cipher question on a test.</p>
    <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
    <p class="in">The only factor for difficulty with this
        question is in the number of characters in the phrase. The choice of letters/words/word length has no
        impact on the difficulty. In general the question should be approximately 100 characters. It is only
        slightly harder to have the students <span class="ctl">Encode</span> because it
        isn't obvious when they have the correct answer. An <span class="ctl">Encode</span> problem is
        also slightly harder to grade as it requires carefully checking each letter
        instead of simply reading the answer.</p>
    <span class="ht">Points:</span>
    <p class="in">An Atbash Cipher <span class="ctl">Decode</span> should
        be worth 100 points (approximately 1 point per character in the <span class="ctl">Plain Text</span>).
        An Atbash Cipher <span class="ctl">Encode</span> could be worth 120-150 points
        depending on the length of the encode string (approximately 1.2 points per character rounded to the
        nearest
        10).</p>
    <span class="ht">Question Text:</span>
    <p class="in"> The question should clearly indicate that
        cipher has been encoded using the Atbash Cipher as well as the origin of the phrase or quote. It
        should not include a hint. Some examples:</p>
    <p class="ex callout small secondary ">Solve this quote from <em>&lt;person&gt;</em> which
        has been encoded with the Atbash Cipher.</p>
    <p class="ex callout small secondary ">Encode this quote by <em>&lt;person&gt;</em> using
        the Atbash Cipher.</p>
    <h2 class="ol" id="Caesar"><span class="quser">All Events</span>Caesar Cipher {3.e.ii}</h2>
    <p>The Caesar Cipher is a fairly simple cipher where once you know a single letter
        mapping, the remainder of the problem is a simple transposition. There should be no more than one or
        two Caesar Cipher questions on a test.</p>
    <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
    <p class="in">There are two factors which affect the
        difficulty. First is the length of the cipher which in general should be approximately 100
        characters. Having a single or two character word in the <span class="ctl">Plain Text</span> also
        makes it easier to solve. Secondarily is the <span class="ctl">Shift</span> of the letters. Shifts of 1,2,3 or
        13
        are
        the easiest because once the shift is known, it can generally be done without even looking it up in a
        table. 13 is a special case because it operates similar to the Atbash in that letters map in
        pairs.
        It is only slightly harder to have the students <span class="ctl">Encode</span> because
        it isn't obvious when they have the correct answer. An <span class="ctl">Encode</span> problem
        is also slightly harder to grade as it requires carefully checking each letter
        instead of simply reading the answer. </p>
    <span class="ht">Points:</span>
    <p class="in">A Caesar Cipher <span class="ctl">Decode</span> should
        be worth 100-120 points (approximately 1 point per character in the <span class="ctl">Plain Text</span>)
        with the 120 point being associated with a Caesar with a larger shift and no short words. A
        Caesar
        Cipher <span class="ctl">Encode</span> should be worth 120-160 points with
        absence of short words, larger shift values and longer phrases </p>
    <span class="ht">Question Text:</span>
    <p class="in">The question should clearly indicate the origin of the
        phrase and that it has been encoded using a Caesar Cipher. It should not indicate the shift amount
        (for a <span class="ctl">Decode</span>) or include a hint. For example:</p>
    <p class="ex callout small secondary ">Solve this quote from <em>&lt;person&gt;</em> which
        has been encoded with the Caesar Cipher.</p>
    <p class="ex callout small secondary ">A quote from <em>&lt;person&gt;</em> has been
        encoded with the Caesar Cipher. What does it say?</p>
    <p class="ex callout small secondary ">Encode this quote from <em>&lt;person&gt;</em> using a Caesar
        Cipher with a shift of 9 (e.g. <span class="fq">S</span> encodes as <span class="fq">J</span>).</p>
    <h2 class="ol" id="Aristocrat"><span class="quser">All Events</span>Aristocrats/Patristocrats {3.e.iii.}</h2>
    <p>These will take up the bulk of the questions. It is helpful to search for a
        variety of quotes and phrases to use in order to pick the ones which best meet your needs. A good
        quote will have around 20 words and about 100-120 characters (including spaces) for Aristocrats and 110-130
        characters for Patristocrats. Note that the only difference between an Aristocrat and a Patristocrat
        is whether you take the spaces out or not, so the same quotes work for both. However, you generally
        want slightly longer phrases for the Patristocrats to give more patterns for the team to find.</p>

    <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
    <p class="in">There are multiple factors which
        affect the difficulty of an Aristocrat. First and foremost is the match of the phrase to the
        frequency of distribution of letters relative to the standard distribution of English letters:</p>
    <table class="c32">
        <tbody>
            <tr class="c30">

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="in1">Table 1 - Frequency of English Letters</p>
    <p class="in1">Fortunately the tool will calculate the <em>Chi-Square Value</em> to give an indication of
        how close the phrase is to a standard distribution. The lower the value, the easier the phrase.
    </p>
    <p class="in1">Secondarily, the choice of words matters. A phrase using obtuse/archaic
        language or atypical words will be more difficult than one which uses simple words. The presence of
        single and double letter words helps to make the problem easier.</p>
    <p class="in1">Third, phrases that start with <span class="fq">it is</span>, have multiple
        occurrences of <span class="fq">the</span> or contain the words <span class="fq">these</span>,
        <span class="fq">there</span>, <span class="fq">little</span> or <span class="fq">people</span> tend
        to be easier. You will also want some samples
        which have repeated words to use for test questions providing hints. In general, it is good to
        avoid
        quotes which are unattributed or by anonymous to allow the author of the quote to serve as an extra
        hint.</p>
    <p class="in1">When spelling and grammar errors are introduced, the problem becomes much harder.
        Likewise, eliminating all the spaces for a Patristocrat makes it the hardest to solve.</p>
    <p class="in1">In order to make the harder problems solvable, it is good to consider using a K1 or
        K2 alphabet to provide some additional hints. A K2 alphabet is slightly harder than a K1 alphabet,
        but both are easier than a random alphabet.</p>
    <span id="Aristocrat_Points" class="ht">Points:</span>
    <p class="in">Aristocrats/Patristocrats have a wide range of scores, but
        there are some general guidance to follow in setting the score. Each of the types below provide a
        nominal range to start with. When encoding the sample text, the tool will report a <em>Chi-Square Value</em>.
        The range of the value provides a general guide to the difficulty of
        the problem (0-20 = Easy, 20-30=Medium, 30-40=Medium Hard, 40-50=Difficult, &gt;50=Extremely Difficult).
        Taking the <em>Chi-Square Value</em> indication as a starting point, also look for short words and
        pattern
        words in the phrase as an adjustment to the difficulty up or down. A problem that is perceived to be
        Easy should not be worth more than 300 points while a problem that is Difficult should not be worth less
        than 500 points. As a rule of thumb, an Easy problem should start with a base of 200 points while a
        Difficult one should be 750 points. For this reason it is often good to start with a number of phrases to
        determine their difficulty and then assign them to the type of Aristocrat/Patristocrat problem. It is
        also worth noting that with a phrase that has a high <em>Chi-Square Value</em>, while it may not be ideal for
        an
        Aristocrat/Patristocrat, it can easily be used for just about all the other Cipher types including
        Baconian, Affine, Atbash, Caesar and Vigen&egrave;re </p>
    <p class="in1">A problem can be made less difficult in two ways. Adding a hint that reveals
        characters makes it easier to solve. With a hint, each letter beyond 3 letters for an Aristocrat (or
        5 letters for a Patristocrat) revealed by the hint should drop 50 points from the score. By using a
        K1 or K2 alphabet, the score can also be dropped by 100 and 75 points respectively.</p>
    <p class="in1">Eliminating the spaces to make a phrase into a Patristocrat automatically adds 500
        points to the difficulty and eliminates any benefit from short words.</p>
    <p class="in1">For example starting with a phrase:</p>
    <p class="ex callout small secondary ">Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable
        man could
        doubt it?</p>
    <p class="in1">with a Chi-Square of 11.50, we see multiple short words (<span class="fq">it</span>,
        <span class="fq">is</span>, <span class="fq">in</span>), and a hint of three letters
        (<span class="fq">man</span>) this problem would be one of the easiest with a score of 200.
        It would also make for a good timed question. By changing it to a Patristocrat, we
        would add
        500 to get a base score of 700. If we encode it with a K1 alphabet we drop 100 points for a
        score of
        600. At this range we should also be providing a hint that it starts as &ldquo;<span class="fq">isthe</span>&rdquo;
        revealing only 5 characters leaving this as a 600 point question.</p>

        In general the thought process here is something that their phone mistyped when texting using voice.
        Generating these takes a couple of tries to get something that works out well. It is best to
        start out with phrases that contain homophones (like <span class="fq">you</span>/<span class="fq">ewe</span>/<span
            class="fq">hue</span>) and then
        either generate
        variations by hand or use a homophone generation tool (like<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://homophonemachine.allaboutlearningpress.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1539274074257000">

                class="c1">). Sometimes you can get lucky trying to send it as a voice text
                message with Siri or
                Google Voice to get a phrase which has been slightly twisted. You may want to
                try a couple of times
                to get something that is appealing. The phones have gotten a lot smarter
                lately and don't make
                as many mistakes as they used to. By using a K2 or K1 alphabet, the difficulty

    <p>Pick a value for <em>a</em> which is not coprime with 26

        be slightly harder. If you are generating tests for multiple regions, pick numbers that are near
        each other. I.e. 7, 9 and 11 would be good to have as equivalent <em>a</em> values.</p>
    <p>Pick a value for <em>b</em> between 1 and 25 inclusive.
        Unlike <em>a</em> where the larger values become slightly
        harder, the value of <em>b</em> can truly be any number

    <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
    <p class="in">There is very little variability in the

    <p class="in">The question should state to use the Affine Cipher and
        include the phrase to encode along with the values of <em>a</em> and
        <em>b</em> for them to use (note that <em>a</em> and

        For example:</p>
    <p class="ex callout small secondary ">Encode the common phrase <span class="fq">The quick brown fox jumps over the

    <p>There can be one of each Encrypt and Decrypt on the test. There are no restrictions on
        the phrase, although try to avoid a phrase with a lot of a's in it. I.e. <span class="fq">An
            amazing aardvark allows all answers</span> would be a poor choice because the letter
        a is trivial to encode. As this question is nominally worth two points per letter, a 50 letter phrase
        is ideal. </p>
    <p>Additionally there needs to be a <span class="ctl">Key</span> to encode it
        with. It should be 5 or 6 characters with no repeating letters and avoid the letter <em>a</em> as
        it causes a letter to map to itself. By setting the <span class="ctl">Block Size</span> to the same as the
        length of the <span class="ctl">Key</span>,
        the problem is much easier than with the default <span class="ctl">Block Size</span> of 0
        that keeps the original spacing. Setting the <span class="ctl">Block Size</span> to a
        size other than the length of the <span class="ctl">Key</span> increases the difficulty
        somewhat.</p>
    <p>Note that for the Regional/Invitational events, the <span class="ctl">Key</span> must

        subtract 20 points. If the <span class="ctl">Block Size</span> is

        phrase if it is
        known. For example:</p>
    <p class="ex callout small secondary">A phrase by <em>&lt;person&gt;</em> has been encoded using the

    <p>This is where the test writer can have a lot of fun. The phrase should be approximately
        80-90 characters long and ideally should be one for which the ending can't necessarily be guessed
        once they have decoded the first half; it is important to make sure that they have
        to work the entire problem. There is little impact on the </p>
    <p>With the <span class="ctl">Words</span> Baconian cipher which is
        the harder of the three options, it is important to pick a pattern for the letters mapping to <span class="fq">A</span>
        and <span class="fq">B</span>.
        Obviously the default with the tool of <span class="fq">ABABAB</span>&hellip; is the easiest and it is
        not recommended to use
        this for the test. There are lots of patterns which work (first half of the alphabet is <span class="fq">A</span>,
        second
        half is <span class="fq">B</span>). But there are some that don't work such as <span class="fq">BABABA</span>&hellip;
        which eliminates all
        vowels from being an <span class="fq">A</span>. Fortunately the tool tells you when the pattern picked
        doesn't have any
        words to match.</p>
    <p>For the <span class="ctl">Letter for letter</span> and <span class="ctl">Sequence</span> Baconian
        ciphers it is possible to have multiple letters stand for A and B, but it is
        recommended to use symbols (which can be pasted into the fields). Having a variety of symbols which
        have potential overlap can make it harder. For example on the <a href="https://toebes.com/codebusters/Samples/Code%20Busters%202018%20Test%20State.pdf"></a>2018
        North Carolina State test</a> was found

        figure out whether the direction of the arrow or the line which indicated the difference. </p>
    <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
    <p class="in">There are three factors which affect the
        difficulty. First is the choice of symbols to represent the Baconian. The harder to distinguish, the
        more points the question should be worth. Second is how much of a clue is provided. Lastly is
        the size of the grouping. By picking a <span class="ctl">Line Width</span> which
        is not a multiple of 5, it ensures that the students have to carefully manage wrapping a group of 5 across
        a line boundary.</p>
    <span class="ht">Points:</span>
    <p class="in">200-400. A Letter for letter with a single
        substitution and <span class="ctl">Line Width</span> which is multiple of 5 should be
        worth 200 points. A <span class="ctl">Words</span> Baconian with a
        complex pattern and a couple letters of clues would be worth 400.</p>
    <span class="ht">Question Text:</span>

        (Spanish words which are substantially like their English equivalent words such as ciencia,

    <p>Pick a phrase to encode. As a rule of thumb for a 2x2 matrix, every pair of letters is
        worth 20 points. Ideally you want an odd length string to force them to use a padding Z.
        For a 3x3 matrix, every group of three letters is worth 25
        points. It is important to pick a phrase which is not a multiple of 3 characters long so that
        they
        must add the appropriate number of padding characters.</p>
    <p>Pick an encoding key. For a 2x2 it is 4 characters long and for a 3x3 it is 9 characters
        long. This is probably the hardest part to making the test as the matrix has to be invertible (<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1539274074286000">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertible_matrix</a>).
        Fortunately, the tool will tell you if it is not invertible. There is also a list of
        known
        valid keys at<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://toebes.com/codebusters/HillKeys.html&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1539274074286000">
            https://toebes.com/codebusters/HillKeys.html</a> for
        both the 2x2 and 3x3 encodings. In general, it is more likely to be invertible if you use
        the letters
        <span class="fq">B</span>, <span class="fq">D</span>, <span class="fq">F</span>,
        <span class="fq">H</span>, <span class="fq">L</span>, <span class="fq">N</span>,
        <span class="fq">R</span>, <span class="fq">T</span>, <span class="fq">X</span> and
        <span class="fq">Z</span>. as they are odd and non-prime, but you can mix in some other
        letters. Just make sure that the keyword is not an inappropriate phrase.
        A total non-sense
        phrase is perfectly acceptable, but it helps the style of the test if it looks like
        a word. </p>

    <p>There should be a single one of these on the State/National test. It should use a
        phrase about 25 characters long that doesn't have too many occurrences of the letter <em>a</em> in
        it, preferably with as large a variety of letters as possible.
        (e.g. <span class="fq">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</span> isn't
        actually bad).</p>
    <p>Pick a value for <em>a</em> which is not coprime with 26
        (1,3,5,7,9,11,15,17,19,21,23 or 25). The actual value doesn't matter, but larger ones tend to
        be slightly harder. If you are generating tests for multiple regions, pick numbers that are near
        each other. I.e. 7, 9 and 11 would be good to have as equivalent <em>a</em> values.</p>
    <p>Pick a value for <em>b</em> between 1 and 25 inclusive.
        Unlike <em>a</em> where the larger values become slightly
        harder, the value of <em>b</em> can truly be any number
        and be the same level of difficulty.</p>
    <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
    <p class="in">There is very little variability in the
        difficulty other than the length of the string. Larger values of <em>a</em> are
        only slightly harder while the value of <em>b</em> has no real impact on
        the difficulty. Picking the two mapping letters so that they are toward the end of the
        alphabet also
        increase the difficulty. Having phrases which use the letters <span class="fq">G</span>,
        <span class="fq">W</span>, <span class="fq">Y</span>, <span class="fq">B</span>,
        <span class="fq">V</span>, <span class="fq">K</span>, <span class="fq">X</span>,
        <span class="fq">J</span>, <span class="fq">Q</span>, and <span class="fq">Z</span> increase
        the difficulty slightly.</p>
    <span class="ht">Points:</span>
    <p class="in">140-240. A good rule of thumb is 6 points per
        character plus 6 points for each of the letters <span class="fq">G</span>, <span class="fq">W</span>,
        <span class="fq">Y</span>, <span class="fq">B</span>, <span class="fq">V</span>,

        <span class="fq">Q</span>, and <span class="fq">Z</span> that are used.</p>
    <span class="ht">Question Text:</span>
    <p class="in">The question should state to use the Affine Cipher and
        the indication of what two letters map to. It should not give the values of <em>a</em> or
        <em>b</em>. For example:</p>
    <p class="ex callout small secondary ">A message from <em>&lt;person&gt;</em> encrypted with the Affine Cipher
        using an
        alphabet of 26
        characters has been received. You have been told that the first two letters are TH.
        With that knowledge, what does this message say?</p>
