                    <h3>Exam Preparation</h3>
                    <p>You will need:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Folders for each of the teams to hold the tests</li>
                        <li>Sufficient copies of the test for all teams. They don't need to be stapled.</li>
                        <li>Multiple timers which have a lap function on them - ideally one per volunteer. The timer app
                            on an iPhone or Android Phone that has a stopwatch function with lap function is sufficient.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p> Before the event begins:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Practice starting the timers and using the lap function to record the times. Make sure volunteers
                            understand how to use the lap function and are not accidentally stopping the timer completely.</li>
                        <li>Memorize the answer to the timed question.</li>
                        <li>Check to make sure that this key matches the test you are proctoring.</li>
                        <li>Place one copy of the test for each team in the provided folders with the first page outside
                            the folder.</li>
                        <li>Adjust desks and chairs – teams may have up to 3 students for this event.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>Running the Event</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When the students enter the room, instruct them to sit down, DO NOT OPEN THE FOLDER, and put
                            their names, school name and school number on the first page.</li>
                        <li>Encourage them to write their team number on all the other pages AFTER they begin the test. This
                            way if their papers gets separated from each other we can make sure to give them credit.</li>
                        <li>
                            <b>CRITICAL:</b> Check to see that students have ONLY brought
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>
                                    Something to write with (pencils, pens, erasers)</li>
                                <li>Five function calculators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and usually
                                    square root). The calculator can have a simple memory store/recall function but must
                                    not have a modulus or other scientific and programmable functions. If their calculator
                                    doesn't meet these requirements, they may not use it.</li>
                                <li>If there are spare calculators in the kit, you may loan up to one per team to use for
                                    the test.</li>
                                <li>If the student has a smart watch (Apple watch, Samsung Gear, etc.) they will need to
                                    put it away.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Instruct the students that if they answer the timed question within 10 minutes, they can be awarded a bonus if they solve
                            the timed question with no more than 2 letters incorrect.
                            <ol type="i">
                                <li>When they have a solution for the cryptogram they should raise their hand.</li>
                                <li>Let them know that you will announce when the 10-minute time is up. After the first 10
                                    minutes, no additional bonus points will be awarded.</li>
                                <li>When you see a team raise their hand, hit the LAP function and head to the team.</li>
                                <li>Determine if their answer is correct (see next page for grading), If so, write the time
                                    on their score sheet.</li>
                                <li>If their score is incorrect (more than 2 letters incorrect), tell the team that the answer
                                    is wrong, but DO NOT tell them what is wrong. They can continue to work on the question
                                    and raise their hand again to be checked. A team has an unlimited number of attempts
                                    during the 10-minute bonus.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Tell the teams that they do not have to fill in the frequency table. It is simply there as an
                            aid to them solving the cryptogram. It will not be graded.</li>
                        <li>Some students may never have used a non-scientific calculator. You should have them enter a simple
                            formula on their calculator: 1 / 26 = * 26 = .. Most will be surprised to see that the answer
                            is not rounded to 1 as they expected but .9999999999</li>
                        <li>When the timers hit the 10-minute point, announce that no bonus points will be awarded and put
                            away the timers. The students may continue to work on the question, but they may not receive
                            any extra points.</li>
                        <li>A team is not restricted to only the timed question during the 10 minutes. They can move on or
                            split up the work if they would like, but it is in their best interest to try for the bonus.</li>
                        <li>When time is up, have the students put writing instruments down and put their answer pages back
                            into the folder in the correct order.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>How to grade</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Teams can have up to two incorrect letters total on their cryptogram and still be correct. The
                            frequency of the incorrect letter is irrelevant. See the example below.
                            <br/> If the cryptogram was as shown:
                            <div class="TOSOLVE">KZBAOF KFXMFXYF</div>
                            <div class="TOANSWER">SAMPLE SENTENCE</div>
                            and the students answered (underlined letters indicate mistakes)
                            <div class="TOANSWER">SAMPL<span class="ul">F</span> S<span class="ul">F</span>NT<span class="ul">F</span>NC<span
                                    class="ul">F</span></div>
                            then it counts as four mistakes (even though the mistake was only in the letter E) and the answer DOES NOT count. However,
                            if they put
                            <div class="TOANSWER">SAMP<span class="ul">UL</span> SENTENCE</div>
                            It is considered correct with two letter mistakes.
                        </li>
                        <li>For questions which have a numeric answer (such as determining the a= and b= values), no mistakes
                            are allowed.</li>
                        <li>Teams do NOT have to fill in the frequency table. It is simply there as an aid to them solving
                            the cryptogram. It WILL NOT be graded. It is included in the answer key as an aid to the grader.</li>
                        <li>When scoring the Baconian ciphers (with strange text or symbols), they can write the answer under
                            the Baconian symbols or on the line provided. Note that you will see lots of As and Bs, but they
                            are not graded as the answer, only what they put on the answer line.</li>
                        <li>As you score each question, if correct, put the number of incorrect letters (0, 1, or 2) next
                            to the question number on the scoring page. Also, put the value for the question into the score
                            column. If they get more than 2 letters wrong, subtract 100 points from the score until it would
                            be zero. If a question is worth 240 points and they get 4 letters wrong, you would start with
                            240 points (for up to 2 letters wrong) and then subtract 100 points for the next two letters
                            wrong ending up with a final score of 40 points for that question. If they had gotten 5 or more
                            letters wrong on a 240 point question, they would receive 0 points for that question. With a
                            650 point question, they could get 8 letters wrong and receive 50 points (2 free letters then
                            6×100=600 points off). Just put the incorrect cost deduction on the score sheet and subtract
                            it from the value for the question. Under no circumstance should the score for any question be
                            less than zero. Note that while the timed question must have 2 or fewer letters incorrect in
                            order to get the timing bonus, a team solving the timed question after the 10 minutes passed
                            would be accepted as correct with 3 incorrect letters receiving 100 points for the timed question.</li>
                        <li>If they correctly answered the timed question in 10-minutes or less with 2 or fewer letters incorrect,
                            you need to compute the bonus time. Take the value for the minute from this first table below
                            <table class="times unstriped">

                            in exactly 4:00 minutes, you would add 1200 and 240 to get a bonus of 1440.

                        <li>Add up all the scores and put the total on the bottom of score sheet.</li>
                        <li>You must break all ties. Indicate the tie breaker by adding .1 to the score of the team ahead.
                            With multiple teams tied, you will add more. I.e. if five teams all scored 200 points, the final
                            scores that you would enter on the score sheet would be 200.4, 200.3, 200.2, 200.1 and 200.</li>
                        <li>To determine how to break the tie, you need to look at the correctly answered questions in the
                            order from the table below. If both teams answered the same (i.e. they answered the question
                            with zero mistakes) then you go on to the next question. If one team had no mistakes and the
                            other team had one mistake, then the team with no mistakes is ahead. For example, if one team
                            answered question #8 (which is the highest value question) and another team didn't, the first
                            team will be ahead.

                        </li>
                        <li>If there is still a tie (typically when you have teams which answered either zero, one or two
                            questions) then you will need to look at the tie breaker questions again and count the number
                            of correctly answered letters. The team with the most correctly matched letters is to be ahead.</li>
