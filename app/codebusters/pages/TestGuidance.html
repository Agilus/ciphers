                <p>The Atbash is one of the easiest Ciphers for students to encode or decode because the alphabet

                    no
                    impact on the difficulty. In general the question should be approximately 100 characters. It is only
                    slightly harder to have the students <span class="ctl">Encode</span> because it
                    isn't obvious when they have the correct answer. An <span class="ctl">Encode</span> problem is
                    also slightly harder to grade as it requires carefully checking each letter

                    An Atbash Cipher <span class="ctl">Encode</span> could be worth 120-150 points
                    depending on the length of the encode string (approximately 1.2 points per character rounded to the

                </h2>
                <p>The Caesar Cipher is a fairly simple cipher where once you know a single letter
                    mapping, the remainder of the problem is a simple transposition. There should be no more than one or
                    two Caesar Cipher questions on a test.</p>
                <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
                <p class="in">There are two factors which affect the
                    difficulty. First is the length of the cipher which in general should be approximately 100
                    characters. Having a single or two character word in the <span class="ctl">Plain Text</span> also
                    makes it easier to solve. Secondarily is the <span class="ctl">Shift</span> of the letters. Shifts
                    of 1,2,3
                    or
                    13
                    are
                    the easiest because once the shift is known, it can generally be done without even looking it up in
                    a
                    table. 13 is a special case because it operates similar to the Atbash in that letters map in
                    pairs.
                    It is only slightly harder to have the students <span class="ctl">Encode</span> because
                    it isn't obvious when they have the correct answer. An <span class="ctl">Encode</span> problem
                    is also slightly harder to grade as it requires carefully checking each letter

                    with the 120 point being associated with a Caesar with a larger shift and no short words. A
                    Caesar
                    Cipher <span class="ctl">Encode</span> should be worth 120-160 points with

                <p>These will take up the bulk of the questions. It is helpful to search for a
                    variety of quotes and phrases to use in order to pick the ones which best meet your needs. A good
                    quote will have around 20 words and about 100-120 characters (including spaces) for Aristocrats and
                    110-130
                    characters for Patristocrats. Note that the only difference between an Aristocrat and a Patristocrat
                    is whether you take the spaces out or not, so the same quotes work for both. However, you generally
                    want slightly longer phrases for the Patristocrats to give more patterns for the team to find.</p>

                <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
                <p class="in">There are multiple factors which
                    affect the difficulty of an Aristocrat. First and foremost is the match of the phrase to the

                <p class="in1">Table 1 - Frequency of English Letters</p>
                <p class="in1">Fortunately the tool will calculate the <em>Chi-Square Value</em> to give an indication
                    of
                    how close the phrase is to a standard distribution. The lower the value, the easier the phrase.
                </p>
                <p class="in1">Secondarily, the choice of words matters. A phrase using obtuse/archaic
                    language or atypical words will be more difficult than one which uses simple words. The presence of
                    single and double letter words helps to make the problem easier.</p>
                <p class="in1">Third, phrases that start with <span class="fq">it is</span>, have multiple
                    occurrences of <span class="fq">the</span> or contain the words <span class="fq">these</span>,
                    <span class="fq">there</span>, <span class="fq">little</span> or <span class="fq">people</span> tend
                    to be easier. You will also want some samples
                    which have repeated words to use for test questions providing hints. In general, it is good to
                    avoid
                    quotes which are unattributed or by anonymous to allow the author of the quote to serve as an extra
                    hint.
                </p>
                <p class="in1">When spelling and grammar errors are introduced, the problem becomes much harder.
                    Likewise, eliminating all the spaces for a Patristocrat makes it the hardest to solve.</p>
                <p class="in1">In order to make the harder problems solvable, it is good to consider using a K1 or
                    K2 alphabet to provide some additional hints. A K2 alphabet is slightly harder than a K1 alphabet,
                    but both are easier than a random alphabet.</p>
                <span id="Aristocrat_Points" class="ht">Points:</span>
                <p class="in">Aristocrats/Patristocrats have a wide range of scores, but
                    there are some general guidance to follow in setting the score. Each of the types below provide a
                    nominal range to start with. When encoding the sample text, the tool will report a <em>Chi-Square
                        Value</em>.
                    The range of the value provides a general guide to the difficulty of
                    the problem (0-20 = Easy, 20-30=Medium, 30-40=Medium Hard, 40-50=Difficult, &gt;50=Extremely
                    Difficult).
                    Taking the <em>Chi-Square Value</em> indication as a starting point, also look for short words and
                    pattern
                    words in the phrase as an adjustment to the difficulty up or down. A problem that is perceived to be
                    Easy should not be worth more than 300 points while a problem that is Difficult should not be worth
                    less
                    than 500 points. As a rule of thumb, an Easy problem should start with a base of 200 points while a
                    Difficult one should be 750 points. For this reason it is often good to start with a number of
                    phrases to
                    determine their difficulty and then assign them to the type of Aristocrat/Patristocrat problem. It
                    is
                    also worth noting that with a phrase that has a high <em>Chi-Square Value</em>, while it may not be
                    ideal
                    for
                    an
                    Aristocrat/Patristocrat, it can easily be used for just about all the other Cipher types including
                    Baconian, Affine, Atbash, Caesar and Vigen&egrave;re </p>
                <p class="in1">A problem can be made less difficult in two ways. Adding a hint that reveals
                    characters makes it easier to solve. With a hint, each letter beyond 3 letters for an Aristocrat (or
                    5 letters for a Patristocrat) revealed by the hint should drop 50 points from the score. By using a
                    K1 or K2 alphabet, the score can also be dropped by 100 and 75 points respectively.</p>
                <p class="in1">Eliminating the spaces to make a phrase into a Patristocrat automatically adds 500
                    points to the difficulty and eliminates any benefit from short words.</p>
                <p class="in1">For example starting with a phrase:</p>
                <p class="ex callout small secondary ">Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no
                    reasonable
                    man could
                    doubt it?</p>
                <p class="in1">with a Chi-Square of 11.50, we see multiple short words (<span class="fq">it</span>,
                    <span class="fq">is</span>, <span class="fq">in</span>), and a hint of three letters
                    (<span class="fq">man</span>) this problem would be one of the easiest with a score of 200.
                    It would also make for a good timed question. By changing it to a Patristocrat, we
                    would add
                    500 to get a base score of 700. If we encode it with a K1 alphabet we drop 100 points for a
                    score of
                    600. At this range we should also be providing a hint that it starts as &ldquo;<span
                        class="fq">isthe</span>&rdquo;
                    revealing only 5 characters leaving this as a 600 point question.

                    In general the thought process here is something that their phone mistyped when texting using voice.
                    Generating these takes a couple of tries to get something that works out well. It is best to
                    start out with phrases that contain homophones (like <span class="fq">you</span>/<span
                        class="fq">ewe</span>/<span class="fq">hue</span>) and then
                    either generate
                    variations by hand or use a homophone generation tool (like<span class="c17"><a
                            href="http://homophonemachine.allaboutlearningpress.com/">http://homophonemachine.allaboutlearningpress.com/</a>

                            Sometimes you can get lucky trying to send it as a voice text
                            message with Siri or
                            Google Voice to get a phrase which has been slightly twisted. You may want to
                            try a couple of times
                            to get something that is appealing. The phones have gotten a lot smarter
                            lately and don't make
                            as many mistakes as they used to. By using a K2 or K1 alphabet, the difficulty
                            of solving it goes down.</p>

                    to work the entire problem. There is little impact on the difficulty.</p>
                <p>With the <span class="ctl">Words</span> Baconian cipher which is
                    the harder of the three options, it is important to pick a pattern for the letters mapping to <span
                        class="fq">A</span>
                    and <span class="fq">B</span>.
                    Obviously the default with the tool of <span class="fq">ABABAB</span>&hellip; is the easiest and it
                    is
                    not recommended to use
                    this for the test. There are lots of patterns which work (first half of the alphabet is <span
                        class="fq">A</span>,
                    second
                    half is <span class="fq">B</span>). But there are some that don't work such as <span
                        class="fq">BABABA</span>&hellip;
                    which eliminates all
                    vowels from being an <span class="fq">A</span>. Fortunately the tool tells you when the pattern
                    picked
                    doesn't have any
                    words to match.</p>
                <p>For the <span class="ctl">Letter for letter</span> and <span class="ctl">Sequence</span> Baconian
                    ciphers it is possible to have multiple letters stand for A and B, but it is
                    recommended to use symbols (which can be pasted into the fields). Having a variety of symbols which
                    have potential overlap can make it harder. For example on the <a
                        href="https://toebes.com/codebusters/Samples/Code%20Busters%202018%20Test%20State.pdf">2018
                        North Carolina State test</a>, the key to the solution was that 'A' was represented by any arrow
                    pointing
                    down (e.g. <img class="imgscale" src="BaconianA.png" />) and 'B' was represented by any arrow
                    pointing up
                    (e.g. <img class="imgscale" src="BaconianB.png" />); so that the students had to
                    figure out whether the direction of the arrow or the line was what indicated the difference. </p>
                <span class="ht">Setting Difficulty:</span>
                <p class="in">There are three factors which affect the
                    difficulty. First is the choice of symbols to represent the Baconian. The harder to distinguish, the
                    more points the question should be worth. Second is how much of a clue is provided. Lastly is
                    the size of the grouping. By picking a <span class="ctl">Line Width</span> which
                    is not a multiple of 5, it ensures that the students have to carefully manage wrapping a group of 5
                    across
                    a line boundary.</p>
                <span class="ht">Points:</span>
                <p class="in">200-400. A Letter for letter with a single
                    substitution and <span class="ctl">Line Width</span> which is multiple of 5 should be
                    worth 200 points. A <span class="ctl">Words</span> Baconian with a
                    complex pattern and a couple letters of clues would be worth 400.</p>

                <span class="ht">Details on picking a key</span>
                <p>For a 2x2 matrix we can be explicit.
                    Since it is very likely that we will want either the 2nd or 3rd letter to be a vowel,
                    The more useful advice would be that one or both of the 2nd and 3rd letters should be vowels,
                    while both the first and last letters come from the set of odd letters listed above.
                    This would guarantee that the determinant is odd,
                    and then we only need to check to make sure it isn't 0 (mod 13),
                    which means we would succeed with probability 12/13.</p>
                <p>
                    For a 3x3 matrix it isn't as easy, but if we ask for about half the letters to be odd (same set as
                    before),
                    then there is a good chance that the determinant will be odd. In fact, assuming random placement of
                    the odd
                    letters, the exact odds for each possible number of odd letters is as follows:

                    worth 20 points. Ideally you want an odd length string to force them to use a padding Z.
                    For a 3x3 matrix, every group of three letters is worth 25
                    points. It is important to pick a phrase which is not a multiple of 3 characters long so that
                    they
                    must add the appropriate number of padding characters.</p>
