                <p>The <a href="QuoteAnalyze.html">Quote Analyzer</a> is used to process a bunch
                    of quotes at one time and analyze the lengh, difficulty and uniqueness of letters
                    in order to allow picking quotes which are ideal for a test question.</p>
                <div id="QuoteManagerFormat">
                    <p>The <a href="QuoteManager.html">Quote Manager</a> uses the same information but stores the result
                        locally in the browser for use when generating tests.</p>
                </div>
                <p>The process involves three steps</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create an input file in Excel or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>
                        format.
                    </li>
                    <li>Launch the <a href="QuoteAnalyze.html">Quote Analyzer</a> and pick a language (typically
                        use the default English, but for a Xenocrypt, pick Spanish)</li>
                    <li>Click on <strong>Import Quotes from File</strong>> and choose the local JSON file</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The Analyzer will process all the quotes and generate a table like:</p>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Length</th>

                            <td>You shouldn't just give during Christmas and
                                Thanksgiving you should be giving all the time.</td>

                    </tbody>
                </table>
                <p>The columns are generated as:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Length</dt>
                    <dd>The number of processable characters (excluding quotes, punctuation, etc.) in the quote

                    <dt>Grade Level</dt>
                    <dd>The nominal calculated grade level for the quote.</dd>
                    <dt>Likes</dt>
                    <dd>Whatever was in the <code>likes</code> input field for the quote.</dd>
                    <dt>Author</dt>
                    <dd>Whatever was in the <code>author</code> input field for the quote.</dd>
                    <dt>Source</dt>
                    <dd>Whatever was in the <code>source</code> input field for the quote.</dd>
                    <dt>Quote</dt>
                    <dd>The <code>text</code> input field for the quote with extra spaces and carriage returns

                    <dd>Whatever was in the <code>notes</code> input field for the quote.</dd>
                </dl>

                <h3>EXCEL Input File Format</h3>
                <p>When the input file is in EXCEL or CSV format, only the first tab is used and the first row is
                    the
                    header indicating which
                    column is used for which field. Only the header columns of <code>text</code> or
                    <code>quote</code>,
                    <code>source</code>,
                    <code>author</code>, <code>test</code>, and <code>notes</code> will be used. All others will be
                    ignored. Note that the
                    header column is not case sensitive.
                </p>
                <h3>JSON Input File Format</h3>
                <p>When the input file is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> format,
                    there are many online editors which can allow easy edit including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://jsoneditoronline.org/">jsoneditoronline.org</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://jsonformatter.org/json-editor">jsonformatter.org/json-editor</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.cleancss.com/json-editor/">cleancss.com/json-editor</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The file starts with a single <code>[</code>
                    and ends with a matching <code>]</code>.
                    Each quote is surrounded by a pair of curly braces (e.g. <code>{</code>
                    <i>quote data</i> <code>}</code>)
                    with a single comma between them (but not after the last one).
                    Here's a simple example with only two quotes in it.
                </p>
                <pre>
[
    {
        "text": "You shouldn't just give during Christmas and Thanksgiving you should be giving all the time.",
        "author": "Alcurtis Turner"
    },
    {
        "text": "Give thanks not just on Thanksgiving Day, but every day of your life. Appreciate and never take for granted all that you have.",
        "author": "Catherine Pulsifer",
        "notes": "My notes go here",
        "source": "Goodreads"
    }
]
</pre>
                <h3>Entry Field Definitions</h3>
                <p>Each entry can have as many pairs of input field strings in double quotes separated by a
                    colon but there are only 5 that the processor will read, all others will be
                    silently ignored. Of those 5, only the <code>text</code>field is actually processed,
                    the others are simply copied to the output.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt><code>text</code> or <code>quote</code></dt>
                    <dd>The quote to be analyzed. This is the only field which is required.</dd>
                    <dt><code>source</code></dt>
                    <dd>The source of the quote. This field is simply copied to the output along with the quote.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><code>author</code></dt>
                    <dd>The author of the quote. This field is simply copied to the output along with the quote.
                    </dd>
                    <dt><code>test</code></dt>
                    <dd>An indicator as to which test the quote may have been used on.</dd>
                    <dt><code>notes</code></dt>
                    <dd>Any notes about the quote. This field is simply copied to the output along with the quote.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
